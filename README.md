# Chess with AI (Web Version)

This is a simple Chess game in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with a very basic AI (random moves).
The structure allows you to expand with proper rules and a Minimax AI.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` - main entry point
- `style.css` - styling for chessboard
- `script.js` - game loop & interaction
- `js/board.js` - board setup & rendering
- `js/moves.js` - move generation
- `js/ai.js` - AI logic (random for now)
- `assets/` - chess piece images or icons (optional)

## How to Run
1. Download this repository or ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Play chess! (Currently only pawn moves + random AI).

Future improvements: full piece rules, minimax AI, drag-and-drop UI.
